Computer Science
I have absolutely no experience with programming
I have always loved techie stuff and problem solving. I loved gaming from it's inception. I raised my son gaming, he started by watching me. He graduated from CSCU in Applied Computer Graphics and is working at K2 Games now. I decided that it's my turn to pursue my passion....we'll see!
